        What To Do When You're Bored

    <p class="italic-text">
       If you consider yourself to be pretty active on social media or other types of online communities, you may have experienced what many savvy internet users call "internet trolls" or “being trolled.”
       Although many people use the term in contexts where a sense of humor is appreciated, the truth is that internet trolling can get pretty nasty and isn't always a laughing matter.
       Being trolled, or the act of trolling, is something we all have to deal with increasingly as the Internet becomes more social.
       Here’s a brief introduction to trolling for anyone who isn't quite clear on what it actually means.

                Those who aren’t quite as familiar with the internet slang definition of “troll” or “trolling” might 
                automatically think of the <span style = "color: chartreuse"> mythical creature </span> from Scandinavian folklore. The mythological troll is 
                known to be an ugly, dirty, angry creature that lives in dark places, like caves or underneath bridges, 
                waiting to snatch up anything that passed by for a quick meal.
